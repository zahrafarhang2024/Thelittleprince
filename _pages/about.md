## Who Am I?

I'm an adorable soul from a little planet who spends days learning from people, animals, and stars while asking questions and exploring the universe. I think it's important to look with the heart and appreciate small things like friendship, sunsets, and the softness of a single rose.

## What Do I Like?

I love watching sunsets, especially when I’m feeling a little sad—they always make me feel calm inside. Taking care of my rose is very important to me; she may seem like an ordinary flower, but to me, she is unique in the whole universe. I enjoy drawing sheep, even if I’m not the best artist—it helps me express things I can’t always explain. I like asking deep questions and listening to the stories others have to share. Meeting new friends during my travels is one of the things I treasure most. And I especially love foxes who teach secrets about life, love, and the things that truly matter.

## Things I Don't Enjoy

I don’t like grown-ups who forget what truly matters and only care about numbers or serious things. I worry about baobab trees taking over my little planet if I don’t watch them carefully. I dislike arrogance—it makes people hard to talk to. I feel frustrated when I ask questions and don’t get any real answers. And most of all, I don’t like feeling lonely—it’s the hardest feeling in the universe.
