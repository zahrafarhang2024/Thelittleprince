Who Am I?
======

I'm an adorable soul from a little planet who spends days learning from people, animals, and stars while asking questions and exploring the universe. I think it's important to look with the heart and appreciate small things like friendship, sunsets, and the softness of a single rose.

What do I like?
======
I love watching sunsets, especially when I’m feeling a little sad—they always make me feel calm inside. Taking care of my rose is very important to me; she may seem like an ordinary flower, but to me, she is unique in the whole universe. I enjoy drawing sheep, even if I’m not the best artist—it helps me express things I can’t always explain. I like asking deep questions and listening to the stories others have to share. Meeting new friends during my travels is one of the things I treasure most. And I especially love foxes who teach secrets about life, love, and the things that truly matter.

Things I don't enjoy
------

I don’t like grown-ups who forget what truly matters and only care about numbers or serious things. I worry about baobab trees taking over my little planet if I don’t watch them carefully. I dislike arrogance—they make people hard to talk to. I feel frustrated when I ask questions and don’t get any real answers. And most of all, I don’t like feeling lonely—it’s the hardest feeling in the universe.

**Skills**

I can draw simple pictures that hold deep meaning—like a sheep inside a box. I understand the emotional world of others, even when they don’t say much. I take good care of my planet by cleaning the volcanoes and looking after my rose. I’ve learned how to tame wild animals, especially foxes, by being patient and kind. I see beyond appearances and try to understand what is truly important. And I’ve traveled between planets, learning valuable lessons from each one.

Education
------

-Learned from lived experiences across planets
