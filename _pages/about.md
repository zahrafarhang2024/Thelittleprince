Who Am I?
======

I'm an adorable soul from a little planet who spends days learning from people, animals, and stars while asking questions and exploring the universe. I think it's important to look with the heart and appreciate small things like friendship, sunsets, and the softness of a single rose.

What do I like?
======

I love watching sunsets, especially when I’m feeling a little sad—they always make me feel calm inside. Taking care of my rose is very important to me; she may seem like an ordinary flower, but to me, she is unique in the whole universe. I enjoy drawing sheep, even if I’m not the best artist—it helps me express things I can’t always explain. I like asking deep questions and listening to the stories others have to share. Meeting new friends during my travels is one of the things I treasure most. And I especially love foxes who teach secrets about life, love, and the things that truly matter.

Things I don't enjoy
------

I don’t like grown-ups who forget what truly matters and only care about numbers or serious things. I worry about baobab trees taking over my little planet if I don’t watch them carefully. I dislike arrogance—they make people hard to talk to. I feel frustrated when I ask questions and don’t get any real answers. And most of all, I don’t like feeling lonely—it’s the hardest feeling in the universe.

**Skills**

I can draw simple pictures that hold deep meaning—like a sheep inside a box. I understand the emotional world of others, even when they don’t say much. I take good care of my planet by cleaning the volcanoes and looking after my rose. I’ve learned how to tame wild animals, especially foxes, by being patient and kind. I see beyond appearances and try to understand what is truly important. And I’ve traveled between planets, learning valuable lessons from each one.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
